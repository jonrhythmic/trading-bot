					      ##############

- Track "recent trades" to make sure to be able to send new money into the queue.
- IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY (ON A TRENDLINE) TO BE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT TO DO IN THE BOT (percent gain / lower + current trend: bearish / bullish / sideways / hodl)
- Improve all fetch() using asyns / await. 
- Improve the fecth'es so it can be customized easily (refactor the code, dude!)
- Hello. Date\time is always ANSI format. 
- ECMA correct way: JSON.stringify({'now': new Date()})
- new Date().toISOString()
- let action in execute_command() is never used! Investigate what it's intended to do.
- Implement a price function that generates: 
  // let five = 0.95;
  // let ten = 0.9;
  // let twentyfive = 0.75;
  // let fifty = 0.5;
  // console.log("5% lower", (price * five).toFixed(8));
  // console.log("10% lower", (price * ten).toFixed(8));
  // console.log("25% lower", (price * twentyfive).toFixed(8));
  // console.log("50% lower", (price * fifty).toFixed(8));
- Improve execute_order()' else if (!req.ok) with proper errormsg for when you have too few coins or other problems.

					      |  MAINLOOP  |
					      ##############

- Generate an setInterval to return a callback ( *** check the max amount of calls to the API graviex allows *** )
- Plan out a scheduler (like a calendar, days of the week, month (march is bad for btc), etc) and a job queue (basically this means promises / also called microtask queue) function 
- Plan out a post-processing method to record and display the details
- Create a configuration-sheet in html the user easily can configure the bot and it's focuspoints

					      |  STRATEGY  |
					      ##############

- Volume and trends: see volume and trends.png
- Strategies: 
*** Divide the various coins into 'stable' or 'volatile'
*** Guestimates: 
    - top-5 coins will increase +10% from live price, and drop -15% from top pr week over and over
    - low marketcap altcoin will drop -25% and gain +7% from bottom over and over
    - popular altcoins will increase 10% and drop -15% and run sideways most of the time
*** Type of trader: diversify, maximalist, semimaximalist / semidiversified, 
*** Per coin type: fish (one of many, small investments), dolphin (pump and dump), whale (tradeintensive highhand, longterm hodler)
*** Market strategies: bearish (focus on stablecoins vs diversified trading), bullish (focus on diversifying), sideways ()
*** Set a goal for trading and divide into percent to trade pr option: highhand, week, month, 1k (+85% - +100%), 4k (+100% - 1000%). Base the percent gained on both increase in coin value and increase in amount hodl'd => bullish more percent of trades on +15% and more, bearish more percent of trades on -25% and more 
- Longterm project: implement the 5 common trading patterns, and make a pseudo analyzis of what the usual outcome is. Also look at "breakout" patterns, they are probably easy to calculate
- CME gaps? Are they vital to keep tabs on?
- Improve the way price handles param: coin

						##########
						|  TODO  |
						##########

- Make sure the function names are better planned out!
- Create function that divides the number of pairs[] normalized by / 100, and make a progressbar instead of printing: Total valid markets: cx
- Correct the fetch to find valid marketpairs to handle text return. Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0
- Make a function that cancels all GIO bids around every new hour to maximize dividens
- Keep track of the price of each coin (24h, 7days, 1mo, alltime) to "predict" future outcomes
- Scrape news sites and message boards for good / bad news to get in or out before catastrophy occures 
- Make a setTimeout func that checks if users has any loose assets, and verify that the user intends to trade then (longterm HODL, daytrading, other strategies)
- Read up on getters / setters and consider using them!
- Consider using const response = await fetch('...') instead of the current way
- Should the fetch()s be wrapped in a series of if-else if? 
- Publish the bot to Showoff Saturday in r/javascript
- Add a way to check daily volume and change in price for any tickers the user is watching
- Write a function that checks the real-time price and current buy side price to put your bids on top
- Read up on Node.js process.exit(1) and consider writing a try-catch block
- You should consider a 'version.json' file to keep track of which version user uses. (Too easy to hack?)
- Make a util.js, tickers.js to keep track of utility function (curr. daily volume, strategies, etc) and tickers to focus on or avoid
- Make a function that allows canceling a spesifics of all trades for a spesific ticker-pair
- Add ANSI colors to output to clearly make errors stand out (see ansi.txt)
- Make a trade history register (stored in a file) to be able to track order status and history
- Make a balance() to retrieve your balance stored on graivex, show available and inOrders.
- Make a MainLoop the uses setInterval(() => {}, MAX_AMOUNT_OF_CONNECTIONS)
- Research if you can collect faucet using the API - NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!
- Implement an option to generate an "all" coins dump strategy for unwanted coins. Should not generate loses, so handle it
- Implement a scraper for /r/WallStreetBets to get on the hype early?
- Implement some kind of strategy based on realtime data, bullish = HODL top 5, bearish = HODL stablecoins, sideways = +/-5%
- Improve the history() to include &to= and &from=
- Class is labelled by a special internal property: [[FunctionKind]]:"classConstructor" (test for this to see if bot === ok)
- Test findMarkets() once every 24h
- Find out how you can add comments into function tooltips (like C++)
- Improve balance() to return an error if the value passed in isn't valid (no coin found)
- Implement this ncurses like Node library to make a simple interface: https://github.com/chjj/blessed
- convert() is really useless and needs refactoring to handle padding to small numbers (like doge), conversion on even smaller numbers (like graviocoin) and not doing anything on numbers that are valid (like ETH/LTC pairs)
- Consider adding Paccoin into the bot!
*** API entry account/history is for withdrawals / deposits, and trades/history is for recent trades! ***
