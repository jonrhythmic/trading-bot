- Generate an setInterval to return a callback ( *** check the max amount of calls to the API graviex allows *** )
- Plan out a scheduler and a job queue function 
- Plan out a post-processing method to record and display the details
- Create a configuration-sheet in html the user easily can configure the bot and it's focuspoints
- Make a function that reads the in demand coins and finds markets containing coin1 / coin2 or coin2 / coin1 markets 
- It's not possible to get user balance or minimum amount for trade pr coin, so make a balance.js and update it using trade history :D
- Implement Coingecko API to get realtime price of each coin 
- Consider generating a new deposit address and scan incoming transactions + trade history to keep an est. balance.

- Strategies: 
*** Guestimates: 
    - top-5 coins will increase +10% from live price, and drop -15% from top pr week over and over
    - low marketcap altcoin will drop -25% and gain +7% from bottom over and over
    - popular altcoins will increase 10% and drop -15% and run sideways most of the time
*** Type of trader: diversify, maximalist, 
*** Per coin type: fish (one of many, small investments), dolphin (pump and dump), whale (tradeintensive highhand, longterm hodler)
*** Market strategies: bearish (focus on stablecoins vs diversified trading), bullish (focus on diversifying), sideways ()
*** Set a goal for trading and divide into percent to trade pr option: highhand, week, month, 1k (+85% - +100%), 4k (+100% - 1000%). Base the percent gained on both increase in coin value and increase in amount hodl'd
- Longterm project: implement the 5 common trading patterns, and make a pseudo analyzis of what the usual outcome is.
- CME gaps? Are they vital to keep tabs on?

						##########

- Make a function that cancels all GIO bids around every new hour to maximize dividens
- Keep track of the price of each coin (24h, 7days, 1mo, alltime) to "predict" future outcomes
- Scrape news sites and message boards for good / bad news to get in or out before catastrophy occures 
- Make a setTimeout func that checks if users has any loose assets, and verify that the user intends to trade then (longterm HODL, daytrading, other strategies)
- Read up on getters / setters and consider using them!
- Consider using const response = await fetch('...') instead of the current way
- Should the fetch()s be wrapped in a series of if-else if? 
- Publish the bot to Showoff Saturday in r/javascript
- Add a way to check daily volume and change in price for any tickers the user is watching
- Write a function that checks the real-time price and current buy side price to put your bids on top
- Read up on Node.js process.exit(1) and consider writing a try-catch block
- You should consider a 'version.json' file to keep track of which version user uses. (Too easy to hack?)
- Make a util.js, tickers.js to keep track of utility function (curr. daily volume, strategies, etc) and tickers to focus on or avoid
- Make a function that allows canceling a spesific of all trades for a spesific ticker-pair
- Add ANSI colors to output to clearly make errors stand out (see ansi.txt)
- Make a trade history register (stored in a file) to be able to track order status and history
- Make a balance() to retrieve your balance stored on graivex, show available and inOrders.
- Make a MainLoop the uses setInterval(() => {}, MAX_AMOUNT_OF_CONNECTIONS)
- Research if you can collect faucet using the API
- Implement an option to select current (realtime) price and place a buy / sell based on it in order()
- Implement an option to generate an "all" coins dump strategy for unwanted coins. Should not generate loses, so handle it
- Implement a scraper for /r/WallStreetBets to get on the hype early?
- Implement some kind of strategy based on realtime data, bullish = HODL top 5, bearish = HODL stablecoins, sideways = +/-5%

    /* bid, sell, cancel, cancelAll, etc */
    order(
	pair/ticker, requestType /buy,sell, cancel,cancelAll
	amount, price) {}
    // Select which pair to perform action on
    pair(param1, param2) {}
    // Select which action to execute
    action(cmd) {}
    /* bullish, bearish, squeeze (take sell of platform), sideways, highhand, week, month, 1k, 4k */
    strategy() { console.log("Applying trading strategy") }
    /* TEST => startup, runtime, close, VERIFY => --- */    
    settings() { console.log("Applying settings") }
    /* startup, runtime, shutdown */
    status(res) { if (res.ok) /* res.status >= 200 && res.status < 300 */ {return res;} else {throw MyCustomError(res.message, res.code)} }
