- Make a function that cancels all GIO bids around every new hour to maximize dividense
- Keep track of the price of each coin (24h, 7days, 1mo, alltime) to "predict" future outcomes
- Scrape news sites and message boards for good / bad news to get in or out before catastrophy occures 
- Make a setTimeout func that checks if users has any loose assets, and verify that the user intends to trade then (longterm HODL, daytrading, other strategies)
- Read up on getters / setters and consider using them!
- Consider using const response = await fetch('...') instead of the current way
- Should the fetch()s be wrapped in a series of if-else if? 
- Publish the bot to Showoff Saturday in r/javascript
- Add a way to check daily volume and change in price for any tickers the user is watching

    /* bid, sell, cancel, cancelAll, etc */
    order(
	pair/ticker, requestType /buy,sell, cancel,cancelAll
	amount, price) {}
    // Select which pair to perform action on
    pair(param1, param2) {}
    // Select which action to execute
    action(cmd) {}
    /* bullish, bearish, sideways, highhand, week, month, 1k, 4k */
    strategy() { console.log("Applying trading strategy") }
    /* TEST => startup, runtime, close, VERIFY => --- */    
    settings() { console.log("Applying settings") }
    /* startup, runtime, shutdown */
    status(res) { if (res.ok) /* res.status >= 200 && res.status < 300 */ {return res;} else {throw MyCustomError(res.message, res.code)} }
